# Load the video clip

video_clip=VideoFileClip(video_path)

#video_clip: This is a variable that will store the video clip object. It's created by loading the video located at video_path using the VideoFileClip constructor from the moviepy.editor module. This line loads the video into memory for further processing.
# Extract the audio from the video clip

audio_clip=video_clip.audio

#audio_clip: This variable stores the audio portion extracted from the video clip. It's obtained by accessing the audio attribute of the video_clip object. This step separates the audio from the video.

output_mp3_file='interstellar.mp3'

# Write the audio to an MP3 file

audio_clip.write_audiofile(output_mp3_file)
audio_clip.write_audiofile(output_mp3_file): 

# This line writes the audio data from audio_clip to an MP3 file with the name specified in output_mp3_file. It effectively saves the extracted audio as an MP3 file.
