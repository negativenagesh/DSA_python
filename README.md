## 📑 Time Complexity Table
| Algorithm/DS      | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case | Space Complexity |
|-------------------|------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Binary Search     | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(log n)   | O(1)              |
| Quick Sort        | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n^2)     | O(log n)          |
| Merge Sort        | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)              |
| BFS               | O(V + E)  | O(V + E)     | O(V + E)   | O(V)              |
| DFS               | O(V + E)  | O(V + E)     | O(V + E)   | O(V)              |
