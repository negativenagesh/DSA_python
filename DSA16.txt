Question ---->

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

Answer ---->

class Solution(object):
    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        if not needle:
            return 0
        
        return haystack.find(needle)
        
        return 
        
        """
        :type haystack: str
        :type needle: str
        :rtype: int
        """

Result ---->

Your input:
"sadbutsad"
"sad"

Output:
0

Expected:
0
